Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No build process or server required!

### 2. Browse Products
- View all products on the main page
- Use category chips to filter by product type

## API Integration

The application uses the [FakeStore API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) for demonstration:
- **Products**: `https://fakestoreapi.com/products`
- **Categories**: `https://fakestoreapi.com/products/categories`

### To Use Your Own API:
1. Change the `API_BASE_URL` constant in the script section
2. Modify the `fetchProducts()` and `fetchCategories()` functions to match your API structure
3. Update the product data mapping to match your backend response

## Features Implementation Details

### Pinia Store Structure
```javascript
// State
products: []        // All products from API
categories: []      // Product categories
cartItems: []       // Items in shopping cart
loading: boolean    // Loading state

// Getters
cartItemsCount      // Total items in cart
cartTotal          // Total cart value with discounts

// Actions
fetchProducts()     // Get products from API
fetchCategories()   // Get categories from API
addToCart()        // Add product to cart
removeFromCart()   // Remove product from cart
updateCartItemQuantity() // Change item quantity
```

### Component Architecture
- **Main App**: Handles routing between product view and cart
- **Product Grid**: Displays products with filtering and search
- **Product Card**: Individual product display with add to cart
- **Cart Drawer**: Side panel for cart management
- **Category Filter**: Chip-based category selection

## Customization

### Styling
- Modify the `<style>` section for custom CSS
- Change Vuetify theme colors in the Vue app configuration
- Adjust responsive breakpoints in the grid system

### Adding Features
- **User Authentication**: Add login/signup functionality
- **Product Details**: Create detailed product view pages
- **Checkout Process**: Implement payment integration
- **Order History**: Add user order tracking
- **Wishlist**: Implement product favorites
- **Reviews**: Add product rating and review system

## Development Notes

- The application is fully self-contained in a single HTML file
- All dependencies are loaded via CDN
- No build process required - just open in browser
- State is managed through Pinia store
- Responsive design adapts to all screen sizes
- API calls are handled with native fetch API

## Performance Considerations

- Images are lazy-loaded by Vuetify
- API calls are cached in the store
- Computed properties optimize filtering and calculations
- Minimal re-renders with Vue 3's reactivity system

## Future Enhancements

1. **Persistence**: Save cart to localStorage
2. **Sorting**: Add price/rating sort options
3. **Pagination**: Handle large product catalogs
4. **Filters**: Advanced filtering by price, rating, etc.
5. **PWA**: Convert to Progressive Web App
6. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests
